HyperionDev Data Science Tasks!

Here are some task briefs for tasks you will find in this repo:

T17: Simple Linear Regression. Exploring how different attributes correlate to diabetes and training a data model to predict whether or not certain attributes indicate diabetes.
T18: Multiple Linear Regression. Using multiple features at once to create a model for predicting diabetes, involving data scaling to accommodate different scales and units for different features.
T19: Logistic Regression to classify Iris flowers according to their feature data.
T20: Using decision trees to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on their attributes. This involves pruning and tuning to obtain a better model.
T21: Leveraging random forests to determine which feature contributes the most when predicting the survival of a Titanic passenger, tuning model parameters and analyzing accuracy reports to define the best model.
T22: Creating and training an image processing model to predict numbers 0-9 based on images.
T23: Identifying clusters of data using K-means model, identifying and using the best value of K for the model.
